## Chessboard Coordinate Game
> This trainer prototype works to improve memorization and recall of the board's layout & coordinate system, which in turn leads to greater comfort reading algebraic notation, an essential skill in game analysis.

## Usage
> When playing as white, the eight "files" - or columns - are labeled **A-H (left to right)**, while the eight "ranks" - or rows - are labeled **1-8 (bottom to top)**.
> When playing as black, the inverse orientation is true. You'll be shown one pseudo-random coordinate at a time, and your job is to click on their corresponding squares.
> Each game lasts 30 seconds, and tallies your correct answers. Incorrect answers are highlighted red until the correct answer is chosen.
> Enjoy!
